# Fixed-point numbers

The [*fixed* crate] provides fixed-point numbers. Currently it uses
the [*typenum* crate] for the fractional bit count; it is planned to
move to [const generics] when they are implemented by the Rust
compiler.

The crate provides unsigned fixed-point numbers [`FixedU8`],
[`FixedU16`], [`FixedU32`], [`FixedU64`] and [`FixedU128`], and signed
fixed-point numbers [`FixedI8`], [`FixedI16`], [`FixedI32`],
[`FixedI64`] and [`FixedI128`].

## Using the *fixed* crate

The *fixed* crate is available on [crates.io][*fixed* crate]. To use
it in your crate, add it as a dependency inside [*Cargo.toml*]:

```toml
[dependencies]
fixed = "0.0.1"
```

You also need to declare it by adding this to your crate root (usually
*lib.rs* or *main.rs*):

```rust
extern crate fixed;
```
