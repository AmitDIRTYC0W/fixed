# Fixed-point numbers

Fixed provides fixed-point numbers. Currently it uses the
[typenum][typenum crate] for the fractional bit count; it is planned
to move to [const generics] when they are implemented by the Rust
compiler.

## Using Fixed

Fixed is available on [crates.io][fixed crate]. To use Fixed in your
crate, add it as a dependency inside [*Cargo.toml*]:

```toml
[dependencies]
fixed = "0.0.1"
```

You also need to declare it by adding this to your crate root (usually
*lib.rs* or *main.rs*):

```rust
extern crate fixed;
```
